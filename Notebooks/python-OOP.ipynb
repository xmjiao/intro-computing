    "Introduction\n",
    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python,  you can use functions by themselves, in what is called a *procedural* programming approach.  While a procedural style can suffice for writing short, simple programs, an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach becomes more valuable the more your program grows in size and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advangates of OOP:\n",
    "* Encapsulation to improve modularity and reusability\n",
    "* Composition and inheritance for reusability and polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "*Encapsulation* is one of the most important principle of OOP: the idea that data inside the object should only be accessed through a public *interface* -- that is, the object's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is not enforced by the language. It customary to start the variable name of a 'private' attribute with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also customary to set and get simple attribute values directly, and only write setter and getter methods for values which require some kind of calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition and Inheritance\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main types of relationships between classes: *composition* and *inheritance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition\n",
    "===========\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a way of *aggregating* objects together by making some objects attributes of other objects.  For example, we can say that a person *has a* birthdate -- if we can express a relationship between two classes using the phrase *has-a*, it is a composition relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships like this can be one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many, and they can be unidirectional or bidirectional, depending on the specifics of the the roles which the objects fulfil.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to some formal definitions the term *composition* implies that the two objects are quite strongly linked -- one object can be thought of as *belonging* exclusively to the other object.  If the owner object ceases to exist, the owned object will probably cease to exist as well.  If the link between two objects is weaker, and neither object has exclusive ownership of the other, it can also be called *aggregation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are four classes which show several examples of aggregation and composition:"

    "There are two distinct concepts, both of which can be called a \"course\",  that we need to represent: one is the theoretical *idea* of a course, which is offered by a department every year and always has the same name and code, and the other is the course as it is run *in a particular year*, each time with a different group of enrolled students.  We have represented these two concepts by two separate classes which are linked to each other.  ``Course`` is the theoretical description of a course, and ``CourseRunning`` is the concrete instance of a course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have defined several relationships between these classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A student can be enrolled in several courses (``CourseRunning`` objects), and a course (``CourseRunning``) can have multiple students enrolled in it in a particular year, so this is a many-to-many relationship.  A student knows about all his or her courses, and a course has a record of all enrolled students, so this is a bidirectional relationship.  These objects aren't very strongly coupled -- a student can exist independently of a course, and a course can exist independently of a student.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A department offers multiple courses (``Course`` objects), but in our implementation a course can only have a single department -- this is a one-to-many relationship.  It is also bidirectional.  Furthermore, these objects are more strongly coupled -- you can say that a department *owns* a course.  The course cannot exist without the department.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A similar relationship exists between a course and its \"runnings\": it is also bidirectional, one-to-many and strongly coupled -- it wouldn't make sense for \"AMS 510 run in 2016\" to exist on its own in the absence of \"AMS 510\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What words like \"exist\" and \"owns\" actually mean for our code can vary.  An object which \"owns\" another object could be responsible for creating that object when it requires it and destroying it when it is no longer needed -- but these words can also be used to describe a logical relationship between concepts which is not necessarily literally implemented in that way in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance\n",
    "===========\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inheritance* is a way of arranging objects in a hierarchy from the most general to the most specific.  An object that *inherits* from another object is considered to be a *subtype* of that object.  As we saw in the previous chapter, all objects in Python inherit from ``object``.  We can say that a string, an integer or a ``Person`` instance *is an* ``object`` instance.  When we can describe the relationship between two objects using the phrase *is-a*, that relationship is inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also often say that a class is a *subclass* or *child class* of a class from which it inherits, or that the other class is its *superclass* or *parent class*.  We can refer to the most generic class at the base of a hierarchy as a *base class*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance can help us to represent objects which have some differences and some similarities in the way they work.  We can put all the functionality that the objects have in common in a base class, and then define one or more subclasses with their own custom functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is also a way of reusing existing code easily.  If we already have a class which does *almost* what we want, we can create a subclass in which we partially override some of its behaviour, or perhaps add some new functionality.\n",

    "Our base class is ``Person``, which represents any person associated with a university.  We create a subclass to represent students and one to represent staff members, and then a subclass of ``StaffMember`` for people who teach courses (as opposed to staff members who have administrative positions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent both student numbers and staff numbers by a single attribute, ``number``, which we define in the base class, because it makes sense for us to treat them as a unified form of identification for any person.  We use different attributes for the kind of student (undergraduate or postgraduate) that someone is and whether a staff member is a permanent or a temporary employee, because these are different sets of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also added a method to ``Student`` for enrolling a student in a course, and a method to ``Lecturer`` for assigning a course to be taught by a lecturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``__init__`` method of the base class initialises all the instance variables that are common to all subclasses.  In each subclass we *override* the ``__init__`` method so that we can use it to initialise that class's attributes -- but we want the parent class's attributes to be initialised as well, so we need to call the parent's ``__init__`` method from ours.  To find the right method, we use the ``super`` function -- when we pass in the current class and object as parameters, it will return a proxy object with the correct ``__init__`` method, which we can then call.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of our overridden ``__init__`` methods we use those of the method's parameters which are specific to our class inside the method, and then pass the remaining parameters to the parent class's ``__init__`` method.  A common convention is to add the specific parameters for each successive subclass to the *beginning* of the parameter list, and define all the other parameters using ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` -- then the subclass doesn't need to know the details about the parent class's parameters.  Because of this, if we add a new parameter to the superclass's ``__init__``, we will only need to add it to all the places where we create that class or one of its subclasses -- we won't also have to update all the child class definitions to include the new parameter.\n",

    "======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example might seem like a good way to represent students and staff members at first glance, but if we started to extend this system we would soon encounter some complications.  At a real university, the divisions between staff and students and administrative and teaching staff are not always clear-cut.  A student who tutors a course is also a kind of temporary staff member.  A staff member can enrol in a course.  A staff member can have *both* an administrative role in the department *and* a teaching position.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python it is possible for a class to inherit from multiple other classes.  We could, for example, create a class called ``Tutor``, which inherits from both ``Student`` and ``StaffMember``.  Multiple inheritance isn't too difficult to understand if a class inherits from multiple classes which have completely different properties, but things get complicated if two parent classes implement the same method or attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If classes ``B`` and ``C`` inherit from ``A`` and class ``D`` inherits from ``B`` and ``C``, and both ``B`` and ``C`` have a method ``do_something``, which ``do_something`` will ``D`` inherit?  This ambiguity is known as the *diamond problem*, and different languages resolve it in different ways.  In our ``Tutor`` class we would encounter this problem with the ``__init__`` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately the ``super`` function knows how to deal gracefully with multiple inheritance. If we use it inside the ``Tutor`` class's ``__init__`` method, all of the parent classes' ``__init__`` methods should be called in a sensible order.  We would then end up with a class which has all the attributes and methods found in both ``Student`` and ``StaffMember``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mix-ins\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use multiple inheritance, it is often a good idea for us to design our classes in a way which avoids the kind of ambiguity described above.  One way of doing this is to split up optional functionality into *mix-ins*.  A Mix-in is a class which is not intended to stand on its own -- it exists to add extra functionality to another class through multiple inheritance.  For example, let us try to rewrite the example above so that each set of related things that a person can do at a university is written as a mix-in:"

Each mix-in is responsible for providing a specific piece of optional functionality.  Our mix-ins still have ``__init__`` methods, because each one has to initialise a list of courses (we saw in the previous chapter that we can't do this with a class attribute).  Many mix-ins just provide additional methods and don't initialise anything. This sometimes means that they depend on other properties which already exist in the class which inherits from them.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why would we want to do this?  Sometimes we want to specify a set of properties that an object needs to have in order to be suitable for some task -- for example, we may have written a function which expects one of its parameters to be an object with certain methods that our function will need to use.  We can create a class which serves as a *template* for suitable objects by defining a list of methods that these objects must implement.  This class is not intended to be instantiated because all our method definitions are empty -- all the *insides* of the methods must be implemented in a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract class is thus an *interface* definition -- some languages also have a type of structure called an interface, which is very similar.  We say that a class *implements* an interface if it inherits from the class which specifies that interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we can't prevent anyone from instantiating a class, but we can create something similar to an abstract class by using ``NotImplementedError`` inside our method definitions.  For example, here are some \"abstract\" classes which can be used as templates for shapes:"

    "Avoiding inheritance\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance can be a useful technique, but it can also be an unnecessary complication.  As we have already discussed, multiple inheritance can cause a lot of ambiguity and confusion, and hierarchies which use multiple inheritance should be designed carefully to minimise this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep hierarchy with many layers of subclasses may be difficult to read and understand.  In our first inheritance example, to understand how the ``Lecturer`` class works we have to read through *three* different classes instead of one.  If our classes are long and split into several different files, it can be hard to figure out which subclass is responsible for a particular piece of behaviour.  You should avoid creating hierarchies which are more than one or two classes deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some statically typed languages inheritance is very popular because it allows the programmer to work around some of the restrictions of static typing.  If a lecturer and a student are both a kind of person, we can write a function which accepts a parameter of type ``Person`` and have it work on both lecturer and student objects because they both inherit from ``Person``.  This is known as *polymorphism*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python inheritance is not compulsory for polymorphism, because Python is not statically typed.  A function can work on both lecturer and student objects if they both have the appropriate attributes and methods even if these objects *don't* share a parent class, and are completely unrelated.  When you check parameters yourself, you are encouraged not to check an object's type directly, but instead to check for the presence of the methods and attributes that your function needs to use -- that way you are not forcing the parameter objects into an inheritance hierarchy when this is unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing inheritance with composition\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we can replace inheritance with composition and achieve a similar result -- this approach is sometimes considered preferable.  In the mix-in example, we split up the possible behaviours of a person into logical groups.  Instead of implementing these sets of behaviours as mix-ins and having our class inherit from them, we can add them as *attributes* to the ``Person`` class:"
